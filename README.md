# Arduino-Motor-Control
simple code to control dc motor by a potentiometer.

Component Required:

1x Arduino UNO

1x Arduino Motor Shield

1x Potentiometer 5kΩ

2x Led (i used green/red)

2x Resitence 220 Ω(for led)

Assembly passage:

1)First connect the arduino-motor-shield on the arduino UNO

2)Load the code on the arduino

3)Connect the potenziometer to the breadboard,Connect the signal pin to the A2 pin on the arduino

4)Connect the motor to the Channel A of the Arduino Motor Shield

5)Connect the first Led on the pin 7 on the arduino 

6)Connect the first Led on the pin 6 on the arduino

7)Power all and try check the file schema for more Details
